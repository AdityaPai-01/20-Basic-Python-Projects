# ABOUT REPOSITORY
Hi, I'm Aditya and I'm a beginner programmer. I've just learnt python and I've created this repository to showcase the very basic projects I worked on to put my Python knowledge to test.
<br>
<br>
I've followed Bro Code's 12 Hour Python Course/Tutorial on YouTube to learn python. After the course, I referred to his tutorial about 20 beginner python projects, which I'll be adding in this repository. I've not copy-pasted the tutorials, but rather make them on my own first. If I've had any difficulties fixing some code, I have referred to the tutorial.
